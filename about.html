      <h2>Simmons Government</h2>
      <p>Simmons has its own unique government structure. From our
      student led initiatives to our unique social "lounge" structure
      to our open house meetings and proposals, we have so much to get
      involved with.</p>

      <p>Contact the Simmons officers
      at <a href="mailto:officers@simmons.mit.edu">officers@simmons.mit.edu</a>.



      <h2>Heads Of House</h2>
      <p>The Head of House team consists of <a
      href="mailto:jessig@mit.edu">John Essigmann</a>, Professor of
      Chemistry and Biological Engineering; <a
      href="mailto:emessig@mit.edu">Dr. Ellen Essigmann</a>; and <a
      href="mailto:srhall@mit.edu">Steven Hall</a>, Professor of
      Aeronautics and Astronautics.</p>

      <p>The Head of House manage and maintain engagement to connect
      students, GRTs, MIT faculty, and other community members. They
      provide academic and personal guidance to students to help them
      get the most out of their time at MIT. The Heads of House also
      manage the Residential Scholars Program at Simmons Hall.</p>

      <h2>Graduate Resident Tutors (GRTs)</h2>
      <p>GRTs, MIT’s first approximation of a Resident Assistant (RA), foster a
      living environment that is safe, welcoming, and inclusive of all
      community members. This responsibility includes encouraging
      personal growth, providing outlets for managing stress, and
      facilitating positive interpersonal relationships. GRTs are also
      responsible for implementing community standards, enhancing
      security, and promoting mutual respect among the residents. At
      Simmons Hall they can also be found flipping pancakes at the
      famous Simmons Hall Study Breaks and organizing floor-wide
      events.</p>


      <h2>Residential Life Associate Director (RLAD)</h2>
      <p><a href="mailto:jogon_1@mit.edu">Joshua Gonzalez</a> is the
      RLAD assigned to Simmons Hall. He is responsible for providing
      educational programming, facilitating event planning, and
      working with the Simmons Government to promote leadership.</p>

      <h2>Residential Scholars Program</h2>
      <p>Inspired by the Report of the MIT Taskforce on Student Life and Learing,
      The Founders Group of Simmons Hall envisioned a combined
      residential and multi-use environment in which the
      undergraduates of MIT could interact with other members of the
      community. Simmons includes many common spaces on the first
      floor that are intended to welcome our colleagues from across
      campus and our neighbors from Cambridge.</p>

      <p>The Residential Scholars program is meant to enrich MIT with
      new ideas and perspectives from people from elsewhere who are eager to share
      their wealth of life experiences. The program is composed of
      faculty members on sabbatical leave from other institutions,international scholars,
      artists, industry professionals, and a limited number of MIT
      faculty members who have shown, by a history of
      contributions to the community, a reason to participate in this
      program.</p>

      <p>The program is based in Simmons Hall but services the entire
      community.  The Scholars, working with the permanent House Team,
      typically run programs on Friday evenings. Since its inception
      in 2003, the financial resources to support the program
      primarily have been provided by the scholarly allowance
      associated with the William and Betsy Leitch Professorship,
      which is held by John Essigmann, one of the Heads of House of
      Simmons Hall. The community is indebted to the Leitchs for their
      generous support of this program.</p>
