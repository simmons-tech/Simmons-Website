        <h1>Housing Policy</h1>

	<p class="p2"> Contact the rooming assignment chairs (<a
	href="simmons-rooming@mit.edu">simmons-rooming@mit.edu</a>)
	for more information.</p>

	<h2>I. Temporary Freshmen Assignments</h2>

	<p class="p2">The Rooming Assignment Chairs (RACs) will
	receive the list of freshmen assigned to Simmons for REX in
	late June, along with the responses to a questionnaire they
	have all filled out listing some basic facts about
	themselves. Using this information, the RACs are charged with
	appropriately positioning these freshmen around the building
	as they see fit. No input from other upperclassmen is
	solicited or allowed, and special requests are only forwarded
	to the RACs from the Housing Department after proper
	vetting. Any roommate requests that are included from Housing
	must be honored. The RACs are also responsible for maintaining
	an up-to-date Welcome Letter to pass on to Housing. This
	assignment has no connection with or bearing on Final Freshmen
	Assignments.</p>

	<h2>II. Final Freshmen Assignments</h2> 

	<p class="p2">After REX and FYRE, Housing will send an updated
	roster of freshmen who will be assigned to Simmons for the
	school year. After a tour of the building and mingling with
	the various groups within Simmons, these freshmen will be
	given a preference sheet to fill out. Using the mindset that
	the collective happiness of the overall class is much more
	important than that of any individual freshman, final
	assignments are left to the discretion of the RACs and the
	results of the preference sheets. Requests for specific
	roommates are honored with the caveat that this is only true
	if the number of requested pairings is less than the number of
	doubles available. Any special requests (medical, religious,
	counseling, etc.) must be made through the Housing Department;
	no night-of special requests will be honored. Any verbal
	agreements with the RACs should be confirmed in writing (via
	an email to racs@simmons.mit.edu) prior to this
	process. Temporary Assignment has no bearing on Final
	Assignment - please do not ask for exceptions to this
	policy. The RACs try their best to account for all aspects of
	the preference sheet, but remember that they are only
	human. If there is a particular issue that a freshman feels
	particularly strongly about, it is highly recommended that
	they talk to the RACs in person about the issue, and use the
	flexibility of the preference sheet to denote such an
	issue. Any student that has been assigned to a room through
	this process may not squat their room during the internal
	spring lottery.</p>

	<h2> III. Transfer Student Assignments</h2>

	<p class="p2">Transfer students that are assigned to Simmons
	have two options. They may elect to participate in the
	Freshmen Preference Sheet Process, or the Transfer Student
	Preference Sheet Process. The Transfer Student Preference
	Sheet will be generated by the RACs prior to In House Rush,
	and distributed to anyone that is eligible and would like to
	use it. Priority in the Transfer Student Preference Sheet
	Process is determined by random number generation. Any student
	that has been assigned to a room through this process may not
	squat their room during the internal spring lottery.
	</p>

	<h2> IV. Waitlist, Readjustment Lottery and Summer Assignments Policy </h2>

	<p class="p2"> Students who have elected to accept an offer
	from the Housing Department through the waitlist, the IAP
	readjustment lottery, or over the summer will be assigned to a
	room at the discretion of the RACs, with the guiding principle
	that the room assignments should be congruent with the
	incoming student's class year. Requests for specific rooms by these
	students will not be honored, but general room attributes they
	would like can be submitted to racs@simmons.mit.edu. Any
	student that has been assigned to a room through these
	processes may not squat their room during the internal spring
	lottery.
	</p>

	<h2> V. Internal Lotteries </h2>

	<p class="p2">Each semester after Registration Day, the RACs
	can elect to hold a Semester Readjustment Lottery. This
	lottery reallocates any rooms that have become vacant during
	the previous semester. Whether or not the lottery happens for
	a given semester is left at the discretion of the RACs based
	on available rooms and demand from the community. This lottery
	is open to all residents, but each student interested in
	entering the lottery must do so by emailing
	racs@simmons.mit.edu after the lottery has been announced.
	</p>
	<p class="p2">The order with which new room selection will take place will
	be done via one of two methods: a manual drawing, or a random
	number generation using the Spring Lottery script. Which
	method is used is left up to the RACs to decide based on the
	number of people entering. Priority within the lottery matches
	that of the Spring Lottery Policies. Freshmen who enter this
	lottery are not eligible to squat the room for the Spring
	Lottery.
	</p>
	<p class="p2">No sooner than the day after the order has been
	determined, the room selection process shall begin. On each
	student's turn, they can select an open room, or leave the
	lottery. If they select an open room, they are done, and their
	current room is added to the available rooms unless it is now
	a singly occupied double. Once available rooms or people run
	out, the lottery is over.
	</p>

	<h2> VI. Spring Lottery Policies </h2>

	<p class="p2">The Spring Lottery is conducted to allow
	residents to select their rooms for the upcoming school
	year. Once the final housing list is sent from the Housing
	Department, the RACs should prepare the spreadsheet, DB, and
	script for usage. Additionally, it is their job to inform
	residents with at least two weeks notice that the lottery will
	be taking place.
	</p>

	<p class="p2">After the announcement email from the RACs,
	residents can begin placing requests for blocking as well as
	room squats. RACs encourage residents to make these two
	requests as early as possible. Blocking and Squatting are
	defined in the Appendix. The last possible time to declare a
	block is midnight the day before the selection order
	lottery. Once this deadline passes, all blocks are final. The
	last possible time to declare a squat is before your room is
	chosen by another person. Obviously the RACs recommend doing
	so ahead of time to alleviate day-of stress for everyone, but
	it is not required. For completeness, if blocking causes a tie
	in the rankings, preference goes to the individual over the
	block, and smaller blocks over larger blocks.
	</p>

	<p class="p2">One week prior to the selection lottery, RACs
	will hold the selection order generation. This involves
	randomizing the order of each subsection of residents. The
	means by which the sections are randomized (script, papers
	drawn from a hat, etc.)  is at the discretion of the rooming
	chairs. However, all information about the process used must
	be public and take place at a public meeting announced to the
	dorm.  The ranked subsections are:
	</p>

	<ol>
	<li> Resident Seniors</li>
	<li> Transferring Seniors</li>
	<li> Resident 9th/10th Term</li>
	<li> Transferring 9th/10th Term</li>
	<li> Resident Juniors</li>
	<li> Transferring Juniors</li>
	<li> Resident Sophomores</li>
	<li> Transferring Sophomores</li>
	<li> Resident Freshmen</li>
	<li> Transferring Freshmen</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="p2">RACs are responsible for publishing this
	official order in a method that they see fit (DB, Google
	Spreadsheet, Posters in Dining, etc). Prior to and immediately
	after the script has been run, a record of the workspace and
	output should be created, and kept until the culmination of
	this overall process.</p>

	<p class="p2">On the room selection weekend, the RACs will
	proceed in order of the published rankings. Each student will
	be given one minute to select their room. If a student does
	not select a room in the period, or is not present at all,
	they will be dropped to the bottom of their group
	(i.e. Resident Seniors or Transferring Sophomores) and the
	RACs will move on to the next name on the list. At the end of
	each group, the RACs will announce the absent students. If the
	student again misses their turn, they will be dropped to the
	end of the lottery (i.e. after the transferring freshmen).</p>

	<p class="p2">The list of residents will be broken into blocks
	of fifty students, with one hour allocated to each block of
	fifty. A block of fifty may start after the allocated hour,
	but will not begin before that time.</p>

	<p class="p2">When a student's turn comes, he/she may pick any
	open room he wishes. If he/she selects a double, he/she may
	immediately designate a roommate. If he/she designates a
	roommate, the roommate is assigned to the room and removed
	from the lottery. If he/she does not choose a roommate, the
	slot remains open and will not be filled without the student's
	approval. If necessary, at the end of the lottery or during
	the Freshman Rooming Lottery, a student will be assigned to
	the open slot.</p>

	<p class="p2">If a resident is unable to attend the physical
	selection period, he may designate a proxy to choose
	instead. This proxy may be another student, who is given the
	power to choose a room for the resident, or the RACs. If the
	RACs are chosen to act as a proxy, the resident should submit
	a preference sheet, indicating the rooms/characteristics he
	would prefer. Anyone who declares a proxy must abide by the
	proxy's decision. Notification of intent to use a proxy must
	be emailed to the RACs <a href="mailto:simmons-rooming@mit.edu">
	simmons-rooming@mit.edu</a> no later than midnight the day
	before the room selection process.</p>

	<p class="p2">50 doubles are reserved for incoming
	freshmen. These rooms are distributed around the building
	during the lottery, with the constraint that at least 5
	doubles per GRT section are reserved. Once there are only 50
	doubles remaining, or 5 in a GRT section, squatting of those
	rooms is no longer allowed.</p>

	<p class="p2">After the lottery has been run and the final
	housing list has been received from the Housing Office,
	residents who desire to may swap rooms. These swaps must be
	approved by everyone involved, including roommates, and must
	be published to official and given 24 hours to clear. Any swap
	involving a resident who cancels his/her housing before
	move-in will be nullified and all residents returned to their
	original rooms. Room swaps for the fall semester are not
	conducted over the summer vacation. Therefore, students have
	until the last day of class (Spring Semester) to request a
	swap. After this, students wishing to swap rooms for the fall
	must wait until after Registration Day, fall semester.</p>

	<p class="p2">The RACs take no responsibility for maintaining
	or verifying bathroom gender preferences. If a resident has a
	strong aversion to sharing a bathroom with a given gender, it
	is that resident's responsibility to pick an appropriate
	room.</p>

	<p class="p2">In special circumstances, it may become
	necessary for RACs to assign a student to a specific
	room. These requests must come from counseling or medical and
	have been approved by the Simmons House Team. These requests
	do not need to be made public and are not open for
	discussion. Resolution of specific situations is left to the
	RACs and house team.</p>

	<h2> VII. Room Swaps </h2> 

	<p class="p2">Students may swap rooms during the Fall, IAP and
	Spring terms. Everyone involved in swap the including
	roommates any must email the RACs, <a
	href="simmons-rooming@mit.edu">simmons-rooming@mit.edu</a>, to
	confirm that they approve of the swap. Once the RACs have
	approval from everyone, they will notify the entire house body
	by emailing the official housing mailing list
	(official@simmons.mit.edu) to announce the proposed swap. Any
	resident then has twenty four hours to lodge any
	objections. These objections will be kept confidential, and if
	they are sufficient the swap will be refused. If there are no
	objections, the swap will go through and the students must
	move into their new rooms as soon as possible.</p>

	<h2> VIII. Special Circumstances </h2>

	<p class="p2">If students have conflicts or extenuating
	circumstances and need to move into a single or another room,
	the request must come from MIT Medical, MIT Counseling, or the
	Simmons House Team, comprised of the Simmons Housemasters,
	Associate Housemasters, and RLAD. No personal requests will be
	considered. Resolution of these issues is left to the house
	team and the RACs. Any student assigned to a room in this
	manner may not squat that room in the house-wide spring
	lottery.</p2>

	<h2> IX. Miscellaneous </h2>
	
	<p class="p2">Any situation not covered by this policy should
	be resolved at the discretion of the RACs, who are encouraged
	to amend the policy if this should happen.</p>

	<p class="p2">With the concurrence of the house team, any
	provision of this policy may be set aside at the discretion of
	the RACs. If possible, the RACs should identify and explain
	any such cases to the House Committee.</p>

	<p class="p2">Claiming early sophomore standing will not
	change one's class year for the purposes of housing
	preferences.</p>

	<h2> Appendix I</h2>

	<p class="p2">Blocking is the declaration that a group of
	people would like to be grouped together. The ranking of each
	member of a block is averaged, and the block is given that as
	their position. In case of ties, individuals have preference
	over small blocks which have preference over large
	blocks. When it becomes a block's turn, they pick in the order
	of their original rankings. All blocks must be declared by
	midnight the day before the script is run to randomize the
	lottery order. Once this script is run, a block is final. It
	is not possible to exit a block by squatting.</p>

	<p class="p2">Squatting is the declaration that a person will
	be keeping their current assignment. There are a number of
	restrictions on who can squat, so residents should be sure to
	read through all portions of the document that pertain to
	them. If a resident squats, they are ineligible to block. If a
	resident blocks, they are ineligible to squat. Squatting
	removes the squatter from the lottery, and immediately assigns
	the squatter their current assignment - once a squat is
	declared it cannot be undone. Squats can be declared up to the
	moment that another resident has selected to room in question,
	although it is encouraged to declare them as soon as possible
	to alleviate stress. Students assigned to their rooms by RACs
	are ineligible to squat - this includes all freshmen, transfer
	students, and residents who have been redistributed by the
	building waitlist. Furthermore, people who have swapped rooms
	since the last Spring Lottery cannot squat their rooms. Any
	official lottery-based room changes are eligible for
	squatting.</p>
