We packed a lot of footage (and not quite so much dialogue) into the video, so to help you make the most of it, here's a shot-by-shot explanation of the goings-on in the Sponge.

                <p>These Sims are dancing in the Mailbox Lounge! The Mailbox lounge is located just past the Simmons lobby, and is where all the resident mailboxes are located. It's also a common meeting and gathering place.</p>

                <p>And now, the Sims are dancing in the Party Room! Check out the throne Christine is sitting on, made of giant legos. Because we are kids at heart, we bought legos as part of a house proposal--</p>

                <p>Speaking of free food, all GRTs will throw study breaks during the week at for their GRT sections! They are a fantastic way to relax and take your mind off of that pesky PSET.</p>

                <p>Perhaps the most-looked-forward to study breaks are the ones hosted by the Housemasters, famous for John's award-winning smoothies. Come relax, grab some food, and hang out with your fellow Sims!</p>

                <p>This is our rad lad RLAD Josh. RLAD stands for Residential Life Area Director, and Josh is part of the house team that keeps Simmons running! He makes a point of trying to meet every Sim, and makes everyone feel like there is someone there to talk to. </p>

                <p>Rima is holding up a rubber duck that she embossed in the Simmons craft room! Located on the second floor, the craft room has plenty of art supplies and a great place to get crafty.</p>

                <p>Over IAP (Independent Activities Period), Simmons teamed up to put together a 18,000+ piece puzzle. The puzzle will be displayed in Private Dining in all its awesome glory! </p>

                <p>Simmons is known for its Top of the Sponge party on the 7th floor terrace, though this year it was relocated to the MPR (Multi Purpose Room) and renamed Depths of the Sponge. Either way, residents turned up, yo.</p>

                <p>Need some quick stress relief? Play a game of Gatas. There's a reason in Simmons that it's known as the Gatas table and not the pool table.</p>

                <p>Sharlene is working in our Electronics Engineering Lab (EE Lab), located in 7B. The lab is open to all Sims; they just have to be trained first in the equipment by an EE Chair.</p>

                <p>John and Ryan are holding up a wooden duck they created in our Woodshop, located in the basement. The Woodshop has many shop tools, including a bandsaw, drill press, and sander, and is open to all Sims to use after they’ve been trained.</p>

                <p>Matt is pretty pumped about getting his nails painted by Diann, a Sim with nail art skills who regularly invites friends to get their nails painted by her. Diann and her decorated nails are a part of A Tower culture.</p>

                <p>This is an example of a Simmons interest group! Interest groups can submit proposals for funding, which allows them to do events and buys things for their group, as long as they are open to the entire dorm. This group decided to buy butterfly combs and learn to do tricks!</p>

                <p>Physical lounges, which are scattered throughout Simmons, are a great place to study with friends, as these rising Sophomores are doing in the 3C lounge.</p>

                <p>Another fine example of student involvement: a proposal was submitted to the house to convert the rarely used meditation room into a ball pit (based on a post from the comic, xkcd), and it was passed! </p>

                <p>The GRT section B tower is this year’s champ! They trained up, but still made the game fun for everyone. Like B tower, many sections dressed up for the games. #HYPE</p>

                <p>We have a 2-story gym so you can train you muscles! The gym has cardio machines like treadmills and ellipticals as well as weights and other strength training equipment. We even have a punching bag, which is great if you want an effective destresser...</p>

                <p>SPA lounge, one of the larger social lounges, is hanging out in the 4AB lounge. Social lounges are groups of 10 or more people that enjoy hanging out, and they receive Simmons funding to host events or buy things for the group to use.</p>

                <p>Simmons dining hall is open for breakfast and dinner Monday-Friday, for brunch and dinner on Saturday and Sunday, and a Late Night Cafe Sunday-Thursday. Our dining hall has the best and friendliest dining staff, and has vegan and vegetarian options.

                <p>Simmons has a lot of unique “sponge-like” architecture, including curved walls throughout the building. Curvy walls are primarily in hallways and lounges, but this lucky double has one and Juju takes advantage of it.</p>

                <p>Our Heads of House, John and Ellen Essigmann, are the actual best. They throw study breaks, eat with students, and get to know most Sims. We love John and Ellen!</p>
