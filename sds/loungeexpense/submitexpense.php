Members of $loungedesc,

** This is an automatic e-mail. **

One of your lounge representatives, $udata->firstname $udata->lastname ($udata->email),
has proposed a new lounge event to be held on $fieldsdatespent .
As a lounge member, you must either APPROVE or REJECT this event proposal.
Remember, only events that are approved by at least either 5 members or
1/3 of the total lounge membership (whichever is more) can use lounge funds,
and each event may use only the same fraction of your lounge funds as the
fraction of members that commit to attending.

You must submit your approval or rejection here:
$approveurl


Event description provided by $udata->firstname $udata->lastname :
$description

If you have questions regarding lounge policies, contact the Lounge Committee
Chair (simmons-lounges@mit.edu).
If you have technical questions regarding GovTracker for Lounges, contact the
Technology Committee Chair (simmons-tech@mit.edu).

Thank you,

Simmons Technology Committee
